## Knapsack
This is a solution for a classic knapsack problem in form of 1/0 but with preferring lighter packages.

# Note
I will move this to a separate library to give it an standard Go form. 

At the moment some Go facilities like Godoc are not able to use this repo.

## How to run
Install Go then clone this repo and run the app as:

```go run toteapp.go```
